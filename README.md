## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` or via the [official installer](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart))
- Basic familiarity with Claude Code CLI

### Option 1: Install from GitHub (Recommended)

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add ajbmachon/general-skills

# Install the plugin
/plugin install ajbmachon@general-skills
```

After installation, restart Claude Code to activate the skills.

### Option 2: Install from Local Clone

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ajbmachon/general-skills.git

# Start Claude Code
claude

# Add as local marketplace
/plugin marketplace add ./general-skills

# Install the plugin
/plugin install ajbmachon@general-skills
```

### Verify Installation

After restarting Claude Code:

```bash
# Ask Claude about available skills
What skills are available?
```

## Usage Guide

Skills are **model-invoked**—Claude automatically uses them based on context. You can also invoke them explicitly using `/skill-name` or by asking Claude to use a specific skill.

### Interview Skill

**Best for:** Planning features, writing specs, fleshing out ideas, requirements gathering

```
I want to build a caching layer for our API - can you help me spec this out?
```

Or invoke directly:
```
/interview
```

**What to expect:**
1. **Research Phase** — Claude does BLOCKING research on your codebase and technologies before asking questions
2. **Devil's Advocate Phase** — Claude challenges your idea: Does this need to exist? Is there a library? What could fail?
3. **Deep Interview Phase** — Once the idea passes challenge, Claude becomes a collaborative partner, asking detailed questions while fact-checking in the background
4. **Output** — A self-contained spec with Problem Statement, Objective, Success Criteria, Interview Record (Q&A), and any corrected assumptions

**Key features:**
- Always verifies technology assumptions against current docs (training data may be stale)
- Surfaces contradictions between your claims and research findings
- Captures Q&A in the spec so future Claude instances can implement without asking questions

### Prompt Craft Skill

**Best for:** Improving prompts, learning prompting techniques, writing prompts for LLMs

```
Help me improve this prompt: "Write a blog post about AI"
```

Or ask for a specific mode:
```
Analyze this prompt and tell me what's weak about it
```

### Authoring Skills Skill

**Best for:** Creating new Claude Code skills, understanding plugin architecture, configuring triggers and hooks

```
I want to create a new Claude Code skill for database migrations
```

### Hormozi Pitch Skill

**Best for:** Creating offers, pricing strategies, marketing copy, value propositions

```
I need to create a compelling offer for my SaaS product
```

### X Post Writer Skill

**Best for:** Twitter/X content, social media copywriting, viral hooks

```
Write a Twitter thread about automation workflows
```

## Skill Details

### interview

A rigorous interview system that produces implementation-ready specs:

**Two-Phase Identity:**
- **Critical Challenger (Phases 1-2)** — Skeptical, probing. Challenges the idea's right to exist. Uses BLOCKING research.
- **Expert Partner (Phase 3+)** — Collaborative, thorough. Helps refine implementation. Uses BACKGROUND research.

**Research Protocol:**
- Pre-challenge: BLOCKING research on codebase, technologies, existing solutions
- During interview: BACKGROUND research to verify claims asynchronously
- Pre-output: Verification research to ensure spec accuracy

**Output includes:**
- Problem Statement, Objective, Success Criteria
- Interview Record (Q&A that led to decisions)
- Assumption Corrections (what user/Claude got wrong)
- Edge Cases, Tradeoffs, Open Questions (when relevant)

### authoring-skills

Complete guide for creating Claude Code skills and plugins:
- SKILL.md best practices (conciseness, 500-line rule, progressive disclosure)
- Plugin development (directory structure, manifests, distribution)
- Trigger configuration (keywords, intent patterns, file paths)
- Hook architecture (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SessionStart)
- Testing and troubleshooting workflows

### prompt-craft

10 core prompting techniques with research-backed impact metrics:
1. Chain-of-Thought (+40% accuracy)
2. Structured Output (99%+ compliance)
3. Few-Shot Examples (+15-30% specificity)
4. Placement (+50% retrieval)
5. Salience (+23-31% compliance)
6. Roles (+10-20% domain accuracy)
7. Positive Framing (+15-20% compliance)
8. Reasoning-First (-20-30% hallucination)
9. Verbalized Sampling (+1.6-2.1x diversity)
10. Self-Reflection (+15-25% accuracy)

### hormozi-pitch

## Tips for Best Results

### Interview Skill
- **Provide context upfront** — The more detail in your initial message, the smarter Claude's research and challenges will be
- **Defend your ideas** — When Claude challenges, explain your reasoning. Ideas that survive become stronger specs
- **Trust the research** — If Claude says "I found library X that does this," consider it seriously
- **Review the spec** — The Interview Record should capture your key decisions. If something's missing, ask to add it

### General
- **Let skills activate naturally** — You don't need to explicitly invoke skills; Claude uses them based on context
- **Combine skills** — You can use interview to spec a feature, then prompt-craft to write prompts for that feature
- **Check for updates** — Skills improve over time. Run `/plugin marketplace update` periodically
